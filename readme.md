# Zig Comptime Antireversing

A proof of concept zig program that is allows for plaintext when coding and encryption when compiling and can execute shell code while being as stealthy as possible (in the future) 

# Stealthy additions
[ ] Entropy Reducing Base64
[ ] Generic entropy reduction
[ ] More encryption methods
[ ] crc32 shellcode checksum
[ ] non-zero padding
[ ] prevent proper decompilation
